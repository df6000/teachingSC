Some code for learning supercollider for sound art!

In addition to the code here, there are several other resources that I'd like to recommend.

First off, the tutorials written by the SC community that are included with the distribution:
http://supercollider.github.io/tutorials/

Second, this very approachable series of videos by Eli Fieldsteel:

Third, the supercollider book:
https://www.amazon.com/SuperCollider-Book-MIT-Press/dp/0262232693
It's kinda spendy but I can loan you a copy for a few weeks if you want to check it out.
